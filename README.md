# Space Exploration Zone Combinator
Combinator that outputs detailed information about the zone in which it is placed. Inspired by Baisius's discord suggestion.

## Features
1. 

## Limitations
1. If a plague rocket converts the primary resource of a zone from vitamelange to coal, the zone combinator primary resource output will not update until it is rebuilt.

## Combinator Mask
1. The source for this mod contains a mask for constant combinator tint for its entity and item - it should make adding different colored combinators easier in other mods.
